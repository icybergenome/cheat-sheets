### Premium Tools for Keyword generation ###
* Keyword Revealer <https://www.keywordrevealer.com/> or KwFinder<https://kwfinder.com/> to check for keyword difficulty.
  * It means how hard is to rank the web based on organic search results.
  * Keywords or phrases with more words for instance *5* words are easy to rank. One word keyword is impossible to rank to top pages.
  * In difficulty analysis following must be of **No** value (On page SEO):
    * Url
    * Title
    * Desc
    * H1
  * Should have couple of sites with **Domain Authority** less than 20 with almost no **Backlinks** in the top 10 results.
  * Usually difficulty of pharase should be less than 23.
  * Sometimes keyword difficulty score might be inaccurate. For instance if a keyword difficulty score is above 25 but you find a web with DA less than 20 and page authority less than 10. it means its not difficult to rank your page in top results.
  * Domain availability of .com .org .net suggests page is easy to rank.
  * If On Page SEO is low  for most of the competitors then ranking your page is more easy and likely.
  * Google doesn't rank pages on top if the phrases require to be written by experts such as medical terminologies. In this case difficulty seems low but it is difficult to rank. See for some affiliate sites who make it to the top **20**. If it happens then more likely you can also rank your page.
* SEMResh <https://www.semrush.com/> to check for organic traffic. Very powerful tool.
  * Using this tool we can browse for keywords that e-commerce sites are ranking for.
  * enter e-commerce site address and select organic traffic, then apply filters such as *start with* **best**
  and traffic flow more than **80** and less than **501** and check for KD.
  1. Enter a keyword and set filter like:
    * Enter Buyer's Keywords i.e. Starts with Best and Ends with Review, Reviews.
    * Search volume greater than 80.
    * Search volume less tha 500.
  2. Enter e-commerce/manufacturer's site address and apply filter:
    * Contains your ***keyword*** or contains ***vs***(i.e. help buyer's to decide which product to finalize).
    * Enter Buyer's Keywords i.e. Starts with Best and Ends with Review, Reviews.
    * Search volume greater than 80.
    * Search volume less tha 500.

### Some specific parameters for easy Keywords  ###
* Keyword should be a buyer Keyword
  * Starts with best, ends with review.
* KD should be less than 25
  * Once your site becomes older google start trusting your site more. And then you can target for harder keywords.
* Easiest keywords have exact match domains are available (.com .net .org)
* For very easy phrases none of the top 10 Google results will have on Page SEO.
* If you see domains with a domain authority of 20 or less in top 10, thats a good sign and phrase is easy to rank for. But if more than 2 or 3 such sites exist in top 10, it means few sites are going after for SEO. But if on page SEO for such sites are nonexistent or Backlinks pages are zero, then its easy.
* Few sites in top results must have 0 Backlinks.
* Presence of other affiliate sites in the SERPs.

**<site:www.website.com> on google will reveal the size of site in terms of number of pages**
**Initially go for longer phrases as site starts to get better rank, go for shorter phrases also**

## Use SILOS for better SERP(Search Engine Result Page) ##
Organize your site's topics in several silos or categories. This way search engine will rate your site better. As it would be easy to find the content on a site like this. Each category should contain a page related to that particular category.

Following two factors are important for ranking better on google:
1. Closely related pages in categories for greater topical relevance of the site.
2. Use **LSI** keyword phrases to make greater page relevance.
**Both site and each page of site need to be relevant to the keywords we are targeting.**

Following must keep in mind for better SEO:
* How content is relevant to each other does matter. Use Google KPT to find relevant subcategory for each     category. Or use e-commerce site to identify sub-topics.
* Each Category should have **25 to 30** pages, so that it will give a relevancy boost to other pages.
* In **anchor tags** text should not be replicate for a same a link if it has been used in multiple places.
* Don't give links to top level pages such as Home or Contact Us.

## Research on Niche ##
* Blogs or existing affiliated sites contents and note the jargons and keywords.
* SEMResh keyword magic tool.
* MerchantWords <www.merchantwords.com> and type keyword or buyer's keywords.
* <www.tinysuggest.com>
* Google's suggest scraper.
* Scrape already top ranked sites, using SEMResh organic search using filters.

### 1. Silos creation ###
* Use Google KWP and amazon to list down.
* Silo should have 30 to 35 related keywords.
* 15 to 20 should start with best or end with reviews.
* Around 5 should be names of popular brands.
* Few should contain 'for','with','vs' or 'under'.
* Around 5 should be informational (Difficulty score doesn't matter for them)
* Use aforementioned tools like keywordrevealer, SEMResh and others to find and check the difficulty of each keyword.

### 2. Select products to promote ###
* Search on Amazon and select product based on criteria:
  * Reasonable high price
  * reviews (with atleast 1000 and 4 to 5 star)
* Check for keyword difficulty of each product.
* Not all products sold on Amazon is belong to big brand.

### Niche Site Keyword Research Criteria ###

* KD of keyword should be less than or eqaul to 35( near to medium words difficulty as per Keyword Revealer)

Since Silos are not implemented in it so we have a freedom to use keywords as long as they match with our site's overall theme.
Creation Criteria:
* At least 25 to 30 buyer's keywords.
* 3 to 5 product reviews.
* 3 to 5 informational keywords.
