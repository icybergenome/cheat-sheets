    * Url
    * Title
    * Desc
    * H1
  * Should have couple of sites with **Domain Authority** less than 20 with almost no **Backlinks** in the top 10 results.
  * Usually difficulty of pharase should be less than 23.
  * Sometimes keyword difficulty score might be inaccurate. For instance if a keyword difficulty score is above 25 but you find a web with DA less than 20 and page authority less than 10. it means its not difficult to rank your page in top results.
  * Domain availability of .com .org .net suggests page is easy to rank.
  * If On Page SEO is low  for most of the competitors then ranking your page is more easy and likely.
  * Google doesn't rank pages on top if the phrases require to be written by experts such as medical terminologies. In this case difficulty seems low but it is difficult to rank. See for some affiliate sites who make it to the top **20**. If it happens then more likely you can also rank your page.

  * Starts with best, ends with review.
* KD should be less than 25
  * Once your site becomes older google start trusting your site more. And then you can target for harder keywords.
* Easiest keywords have exact match domains are available (.com .net .org)
* For very easy phrases none of the top 10 Google results will have on Page SEO.
* If you see domains with a domain authority of 20 or less in top 10, thats a good sign and phrase is easy to rank for. But if more than 2 or 3 such sites exist in top 10, it means few sites are going after for SEO. But if on page SEO for such sites are nonexistent or Backlinks pages are zero, then its easy.
* Few sites in top results must have 0 Backlinks.
* Presence of other affiliate sites in the SERPs.
